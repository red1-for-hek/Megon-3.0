# AgentForge Architecture

Three layers: an ElizaOS v2 plugin backend (6,703 lines TypeScript), a React 19 frontend (3,605 lines including 11 shadcn/ui components), and worker Docker containers deployed to Nosana GPU nodes. The backend plans and orchestrates DAG pipelines. The frontend visualizes them in real-time. The workers execute agent tasks on rented GPUs.

## Plugin Architecture

The plugin implements every field of the ElizaOS `Plugin` interface: actions, providers, evaluators, events, routes, tests, and init.

```mermaid

    Mgr --> NosanaSDK[nosana/kit SDK]

    Init --> Mgr
```

### init

Called once at plugin load. Does four things:

1. Initializes `NosanaManager` with the API key from `NOSANA_API_KEY`
2. Fetches and logs available GPU markets and credit balance
3. Starts a standalone Express server on port 3001 with 16 REST endpoints (the Fleet API)
4. Creates a Socket.IO server on the Fleet API for mission progress messages

The standalone server exists because ElizaOS plugin routes are mounted on the ElizaOS server (port 3000), but the frontend Vite proxy points at port 3001. Both serve the same data.

The Express server uses configurable CORS (via `CORS_ORIGIN` env var, default `http://localhost:5173`) and a 1MB body size limit on `express.json()`.

### Actions

| Action | Trigger | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `EXECUTE_MISSION` | "research X and write Y", "compare A vs B" | Plans DAG, deploys agents per depth level, chains outputs, auto-stops |
| `CREATE_AGENT_FROM_TEMPLATE` | "create an agent that..." | Picks template from NLP, deploys single agent |
| `DEPLOY_AGENT` | "deploy X on a 4090" | Deploys a container with optional GPU preference. Validates Docker image name format |
| `CHECK_FLEET_STATUS` | "show my fleet", "status" | Lists all deployments with costs and uptime |
| `SCALE_REPLICAS` | "scale X to 3 replicas" | Updates replica count via SDK |
| `STOP_DEPLOYMENT` | "stop the researcher" | Graceful stop with final cost calculation |

Each action has `validate` (regex/keyword matching) and `handler` (async, with callback for chat responses).

## Message Architecture

Two Socket.IO servers handle different message types:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph ElizaOS Server - Port 3000
        ESocket[Socket.IO]
        EDB[(central_messages DB)]
    end
    subgraph Fleet API Server - Port 3001
        FSocket[Socket.IO at /fleet/socket.io]
    end
    subgraph Frontend
        EClient[ElizaOS Socket Client]
        FClient[Fleet Socket Client]
        Dispatch[dispatchMessage]
        ChatPanel[ChatPanel]
    end
    ESocket -->|messageBroadcast| EClient
    FSocket -->|messageBroadcast| FClient
    EClient --> Dispatch
    FClient --> Dispatch
    Dispatch --> ChatPanel
```

**ElizaOS Socket.IO** (port 3000): Handles user chat input and two bookend messages per mission ("Mission received!" and "Mission Complete!"). These persist to the `central_messages` database for conversation history.

**Fleet API Socket.IO** (port 3001, path `/fleet/socket.io`): Handles all ephemeral mission progress updates (deploy status, agent working, step completion, cost tracking). These are emitted directly without database writes, avoiding duplicate-key SQL errors that occur when ElizaOS tries to INSERT progress messages with the same derived message ID.

The frontend connects to both sockets in `elizaClient.ts` and merges messages into a single `messageListeners` callback chain. The `ChatPanel` component sees a unified message stream.

## Data Flow: Mission Execution

This is the full sequence for a competitive analysis mission ("compare CrewAI vs AutoGen vs ElizaOS"):

```

## NosanaManager

Singleton (`getNosanaManager()`). Wraps the `@nosana/kit` SDK. All Nosana API interactions go through this class. If a new API key is passed that differs from the current instance, the singleton is re-created.

### createAndStartDeployment

The core deployment flow:

1. **Credit pre-check.** Calls `getCreditsBalance()`. If `balance < hourly cost`, throws with a clear message including current balance and required amount
2. **Market validation.** Only PREMIUM markets accepted (community markets reject credit payments)
3. **Job definition.** Builds a Nosana job with `container/run` op, Docker image, exposed port 3000, and env vars
4. **SDK call.** Tries `api.deployments.pipe()` first, falls back to `api.deployments.create()` + `start()` for SDK compatibility
5. **Status verification.** Waits 5 seconds, then refreshes status. If error/stopped, throws immediately
6. **QUEUED handling.** If status is queued, enters `waitForRunningOrFallback`:
   - Polls every 10 seconds
   - After 120 seconds queued, cancels and tries `getNextBestMarket()` (excludes already-tried addresses)
   - Up to 3 market attempts
   - Absolute timeout: 10 minutes

### Deployment Status Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft
    draft --> starting : SDK deploy
    starting --> running : container booted
    starting --> queued : no GPU nodes available
    starting --> error : deploy failed
    queued --> running : node became available
    queued --> starting : market fallback (after 120s)
    running --> stopping : stopDeployment called
    stopping --> stopped : graceful shutdown
    running --> error : crash detected
    stopped --> [*]
    error --> [*]
```

### getCreditsBalance

Dual strategy:
1. SDK method: `api.credits.balance()`, computes `assigned - reserved - settled`
2. HTTP fallback: `GET https://dashboard.k8s.prd.nos.ci/api/credits/balance` with Bearer token and 10s timeout

### Market Selection

`getMarkets()` fetches from API, caches for 2 minutes. Computes user cost as `usd_reward_per_hour * (1 + network_fee_percentage / 100)`. `getBestMarket()` returns the cheapest PREMIUM market. `getNextBestMarket(excludeAddresses)` skips already-tried markets for QUEUED fallback. 6 hardcoded GPU market addresses serve as fallback when the API is unavailable.

### Fleet Status

`getFleetStatus()` auto-refreshes active deployments every 15 seconds via `refreshDeploymentStatus()`. Each refresh calls `api.deployments.get()` and maps the Nosana status string through `NOSANA_STATUS_MAP` (handles `insufficient_funds` to `error`, `queued`, etc). Updates URL from endpoint data.

## MissionOrchestrator

2,473 lines. The biggest file. Handles DAG planning, parallel execution, media generation, and mission lifecycle.

### execute()

The main method. Flow:

1. **Orphan cleanup.** Gets fleet status, stops all running/starting agents from previous missions
2. **Plan pipeline.** Calls `planPipeline()` which tries LLM first, regex fallback second
3. **Calculate depth levels.** `calculateDepthLevels()` does a recursive DFS to assign each step a depth based on its dependencies
4. **Pre-boot all GPU resources.** Deploys ALL workers + ComfyUI media services in parallel at T=0
5. **Execute per level.** For each depth level 0..N:
   - Execute all ready agents in parallel (`Promise.all`)
   - Multimodal steps (image-generator, video-generator, narrator) execute directly without workers
   - Narrate completion with timing
6. **Media assembly.** If pipeline has image + scene data, assemble final slideshow video via FFmpeg
7. **Determine final output.** Leaf nodes (no other step depends on them) provide the output
8. **Cleanup.** Stop all deployed agents and media services

### planPipeline()

Two strategies:

**LLM Planner.** Sends mission to the LLM endpoint (`OPENAI_API_URL/chat/completions`) with a system prompt that explains the template/dependency format. Expects a JSON array. Temperature 0.3, timeout 120s.

**Regex Fallback.** Pattern matching for common mission types:
- Competitive analysis: detects "competitive analysis", "vs", "compare". Uses `extractComparisonSubjects()` to parse "X vs Y vs Z". Generates a 5-step pipeline: 1 lead researcher, N parallel subject researchers, 1 analyst
- Parallel "AND" pattern: splits on "and" for 3+ segments
- Sequential keywords: chains researcher, analyst, writer based on detected keywords
- Default: researcher then writer

### Pipeline State

Exposed via `getPipelineState()` for the REST endpoint. Frontend polls `GET /fleet/mission` every 2 seconds. State includes step status, output preview (first 300 chars), deployment IDs, URLs, market info, depth/parallel index for canvas layout.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> idle
    idle --> planning : mission received
    planning --> deploying : pipeline planned
    deploying --> executing : agents deployed
    executing --> complete : all steps done
    executing --> error : all steps failed
    complete --> idle : reset
    error --> idle : reset
```

### Prompt Engineering

Template-specific prompt builders handle different pipeline positions:

- **Root prompts** (first step, no parent input). Researcher variant includes web search instructions and anti-acknowledgment rules ("Do NOT say 'I will research'. Actually DO the research RIGHT NOW")
- **Sequential prompts** (single parent). Includes parent output as context
- **Merge prompts** (multiple parents). Includes all parent outputs. Adds structured report requirements (executive summary, comparison table, etc.)
- **Fallback prompts** (parent failed or unavailable). Uses own knowledge

### Media Generation

Three multimodal template types execute directly (no worker deployment needed):

- **image-generator**: Uses `ImageGenRouter` with fallback chain. Generates images per scene from scene-writer output. Multiple images can generate in parallel
- **video-generator**: Routes scene images through `ImageGenRouter.generate()` (DALL-E 3 when `IMAGE_API_KEY` set, ComfyUI SD 1.5 fallback). Assembles images + TTS audio into MP4 slideshow via `MediaAssembler`. Parses video duration from mission text (15s-300s) to calculate word count, scene count, and seconds-per-scene dynamically
- **narrator**: Uses `generateTTS()` with ElevenLabs/OpenAI/fal.ai/Coqui fallback chain. Returns audio buffer stored in memory media store

### Media Storage

In-memory store with eviction:
- TTL: 1 hour
- Max entries: 100
- Max total size: 500MB
- Evicts oldest first when limits exceeded
- Served via `GET /fleet/media/:id`

## WorkerClient

Communicates with deployed ElizaOS instances running on GPU nodes. Validates URLs to only allow `http://` or `https://` protocols.

### Dual Strategy for Message Delivery

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Orch as Orchestrator
    participant WC as WorkerClient
    participant Agent as GPU Agent

    Orch->>WC: sendMessage with task
    WC->>Agent: GET dm-channel
    Agent-->>WC: channelId
    WC->>Agent: Snapshot existing messages
    WC->>Agent: POST message with transport http
    alt agentResponse in HTTP body
        Agent-->>WC: Synchronous response
        Note over WC: Fast path (30 to 60s typical)
    else No agentResponse
        Note over WC: Fallback: poll channel messages
        loop Every 3 seconds
            WC->>Agent: GET channel messages
            Agent-->>WC: Check for new agent messages
        end
    end
    alt Researcher mode
        Note over WC: Wait up to 90s for web enrichment
        loop Every 5 seconds
            WC->>Agent: GET channel messages
            Note over WC: Track longest response
        end
        WC-->>Orch: Best enriched response
    else Standard mode
        WC-->>Orch: First valid response
    end
```

**Strategy 1 (HTTP Synchronous).** POST to `/api/messaging/channels/{id}/messages` with `transport: "http"`. ElizaOS processes the message and returns `agentResponse` in the HTTP body. Works about 50% of the time with Qwen3.5.

**Strategy 2 (Channel Polling).** If no `agentResponse`, poll channel messages every 3 seconds. Filters out orchestrator's own messages and messages shorter than 20 chars. Takes the latest agent message. Timeout: 300 seconds.

**503 Retry.** If the POST returns 503 (service initializing), waits 10 seconds and retries once.

**Enrichment Wait.** For researcher agents (`waitForEnrichment: true`), after getting the initial response, polls for up to 90 seconds looking for a longer response. This catches the pattern where the agent replies immediately, then does a web search, then replies again with richer content. Takes the longest response found. Confirms after 30 seconds if an enriched response was found.

## Frontend Architecture

React 19, Vite 8, Tailwind 4, 11 shadcn/ui components. Split into 3 stores (Zustand), 4 pollers/clients, and 7 UI components.

### Stores

| Store | File | Lines | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `chatStore` | chatStore.ts | 39 | Messages array, loading state, agent ID |
| `fleetStore` | fleetStore.ts | 83 | Deployments, markets, credits, agent activity |
| `missionStore` | missionStore.ts | 118 | Pipeline status, steps, final output. `updateFromServer()` maps API response |

### Polling

| Poller | Interval | Endpoint | Store |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Fleet status | 5s | `GET /fleet` | `fleetStore.setDeployments` |
| Credits | 30s | `GET /fleet/credits` | `fleetStore.setCreditsBalance` |
| Markets | 60s | `GET /fleet/markets` | `fleetStore.setMarkets` |
| Mission | 2s | `GET /fleet/mission` | `missionStore.updateFromServer` |

All pollers use `setInterval` with proper cleanup on unmount. Errors are logged to console (best-effort polling).

### Socket.IO Client

`elizaClient.ts` manages two Socket.IO connections:

1. **ElizaOS socket** (path `/socket.io`, port 3000): Agent discovery (`GET /api/agents`), DM channel creation, user message sending, and agent responses. Listens for `messageBroadcast` events
2. **Fleet API socket** (path `/fleet/socket.io`, port 3001): Mission progress updates from the orchestrator. Also listens for `messageBroadcast` events

Both sockets feed into a shared `dispatchMessage()` function that converts payloads into `ChannelMessage` objects and forwards them to all registered listeners. The `ChatPanel` registers one listener that filters out internal messages (`Executing action:` prefix) and adds agent responses to the chat store.

User IDs are persisted in localStorage and validated as UUIDs on retrieval.

### Markdown Renderer

`markdown.ts` converts markdown to HTML for rendering in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Sanitizes input by escaping `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'` to HTML entities before applying regex-based markdown transformations. A post-render pass strips any `on*` event handler attributes as an additional XSS defense.

## Docker

Two Docker images:

**Main image** (`drewdockerus/agent-challenge:latest`). Built from `Dockerfile` (44 lines). Runs ElizaOS with the plugin-nosana plugin. Exposes ports 3000 (ElizaOS) and 3001 (Fleet API). Base: `node:23-slim`. Installs bun, builds frontend, compiles TypeScript. Runs as non-root user (`appuser`).

**Worker image** (`drewdockerus/agentforge-worker:latest`). Deployed to GPU nodes by the orchestrator. Runs a standalone ElizaOS instance with template-specific plugins. Receives tasks via HTTP from the WorkerClient on the main instance.

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

**In-memory state only.** Pipeline state, deployment records, and mission history are kept in memory. Restarting the process loses all state. This is acceptable for agent orchestration where missions are ephemeral, but means there is no way to resume a mission after a crash.

**Standalone Fleet API.** The plugin starts its own Express server on port 3001 in addition to the ElizaOS plugin routes on port 3000. This duplication exists because the Vite dev proxy needs a stable target, and ElizaOS plugin route mounting is not guaranteed for side-effect-only imports.

**Dual Socket.IO for progress messages.** Mission progress updates bypass ElizaOS callbacks and emit directly via the Fleet API Socket.IO. This avoids duplicate-key SQL errors that occur when ElizaOS tries to INSERT progress messages into `central_messages` with the same derived message ID. Only the initial "Mission received!" and final "Mission Complete!" messages use the ElizaOS callback to persist in conversation history.

**Fire-and-forget mission execution.** `POST /fleet/mission/execute` returns immediately and runs the mission in the background. The frontend polls for status. This avoids HTTP timeout issues on long-running missions (which can take 5+ minutes), but means there is no request-level error handling once the mission starts.

**Dual message delivery.** The WorkerClient uses both synchronous HTTP and polling. This redundancy is intentional. The synchronous path is faster but only works about 50% of the time with certain LLM models. The polling fallback always works but is slower. Both are kept because removing either would cause failures.

**Hardcoded GPU market addresses.** 6 market addresses are hardcoded as fallbacks when the Nosana API is unreachable. These could become stale if Nosana changes its market addresses. The API-fetched markets are always preferred.

**Video via slideshow, not model inference.** The `videoGenRouter.ts` is a stub (9 lines, always returns 'none'). Video output is produced by assembling scene images + TTS audio into an MP4 slideshow via FFmpeg. This works but produces slideshows rather than AI-generated video. True video generation could be added when Wan Video or similar endpoints are available.
