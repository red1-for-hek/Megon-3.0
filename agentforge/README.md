## 📦 Project Overview

AgentForge is an ElizaOS v2 plugin that transforms natural language missions into multi-agent DAG pipelines orchestrated across Nosana's decentralized GPU network. Built with TypeScript, React 19, ReactFlow, and the Nosana SDK, it demonstrates deep integration with decentralized compute infrastructure for real AI workloads.

### 🎯 Key Highlights

- **Multi-Agent DAG Orchestration:** Plan and execute pipelines of 2-10 agents with automatic dependency resolution and parallel execution
- **Live ReactFlow Canvas:** Watch agents deploy, process, and complete in real time with animated edges, status indicators, and click-to-view outputs
- **Multimodal Video Pipeline:** Type "make me a 30-second video about ants" and get a narrated MP4 with AI-generated images, TTS voiceover, and FFmpeg assembly
- **Blockchain GPU Detection:** Read GPU market availability directly from Solana via @nosana/kit. Mutex-based claim tracking prevents market oversaturation
- **Self-Hosted LLM:** Gemma 4 26B MoE running on a Nosana RTX 3090 ($0.19/hr). No cloud API dependency for core inference
- **Adaptive Video Duration:** Parse "30s", "2 minute", "1:30" from mission text. Dynamically calculate word count, scene count, and seconds per scene
- **Smart API Key Routing:** TTS_API_KEY auto-detects ElevenLabs/OpenAI/fal.ai. IMAGE_API_KEY routes to DALL-E 3 (skipping ComfyUI GPU deployment)
- **9 Agent Templates:** Researcher, writer, analyst, monitor, publisher, scene-writer, image-generator, video-generator, narrator
- **Cost Tracking:** Live credit balance, per-agent cost/hr, total mission cost. All visible in the UI
- **10,300+ Lines of TypeScript:** Production-grade code with security audit, 12 mermaid diagrams, comprehensive documentation

An ElizaOS v2 plugin that turns natural language missions into multi-agent DAG pipelines running on Nosana's decentralized GPU network. Type "create a 30s video about ants" and it deploys 5 agents across separate GPU nodes, boots ComfyUI for image generation, generates TTS narration, and assembles a slideshow video. Type "compare CrewAI vs AutoGen vs ElizaOS" and it runs 3 researchers in parallel, merges results through an analyst, and shows everything live on a ReactFlow canvas.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Andy00L/agent-challenge-4.git
cd agent-challenge-4

# Install
bun install
cd frontend && bun install && cd ..

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set NOSANA_API_KEY from https://deploy.nosana.com/account/
# OPENAI_API_URL, MODEL_NAME, and OPENAI_API_KEY are pre-configured for Nosana inference

# Run (starts ElizaOS + Vite dev server)
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The chat connects to ElizaOS on port 3000 via Socket.IO. Fleet API runs on port 3001.

### 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker build -t agentforge .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env agentforge
```

### 📋 Nosana Job Definition

Deploy directly to Nosana using the included job definition:

```bash
nosana job create nos_job_def/nosana_eliza_job_definition.json --market <market-address>
```

## ⚡ What It Does

6 ElizaOS actions handle everything from single agent deployment to full parallel pipelines. The orchestrator plans a DAG, deploys one agent per GPU node, chains outputs between depth levels, and auto-stops everything when done to save credits.

The frontend is a split-panel app: chat on the left (Socket.IO), ReactFlow canvas or fleet dashboard on the right. The canvas updates every 2 seconds with node status, parallel execution indicators, and click-to-view output panels. Fleet dashboard shows live GPU market pricing, credit balance, and per-agent cost tracking.

9 agent templates (researcher, writer, analyst, monitor, publisher, scene-writer, image-generator, video-generator, narrator) with automatic template selection from natural language. Multimodal pipeline: ComfyUI SD 1.5 for images, ElevenLabs/OpenAI/fal.ai/Coqui for TTS, FFmpeg slideshow assembly for video. Researchers get Tavily web search with a 90-second enrichment window. Workers run as Docker containers on Nosana GPU nodes via `@nosana/kit` SDK.

## 🔧 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User types mission] --> B[Plan DAG pipeline]
    B --> C[Deploy agents to Nosana GPUs]
    C --> D[Execute per depth level]
    D --> E[Merge results]
    E --> F[Display on ReactFlow canvas]
```

1. User sends a mission via chat (Socket.IO to ElizaOS)
2. `EXECUTE_MISSION` action triggers the `MissionOrchestrator`
3. Orchestrator plans a DAG (LLM planner with regex fallback for competitive analysis, video, research+write patterns)
4. Pre-boots ALL GPU resources in parallel at T=0: workers + ComfyUI media service (if video/image pipeline)
5. Each worker selects its own market via atomic `selectAndClaim()` (mutex prevents oversaturation)
6. Executes level by level. Agents at the same depth run in parallel. Multimodal steps (image, video, narrator) execute directly
7. Failed dependencies cascade: if a critical step fails, downstream steps are skipped (not executed with garbage input)
8. Outputs chain forward. Video pipeline: scenes + images + TTS audio assembled into MP4 slideshow
9. All agents and media services auto-stop when complete. Credits stop burning

## 🌟 Key Features

**DAG Parallel Pipelines.** The orchestrator computes depth levels from the dependency graph. Agents at the same depth deploy and execute via `Promise.all`. A competitive analysis runs 3 researchers in parallel, then feeds all results to 1 analyst.

**Live ReactFlow Canvas.** Custom `MissionNode` components with status dots, progress animations, and click-to-expand output. Edges show data flow between agents. The canvas auto-layouts using depth and parallel index.

**Blockchain GPU Detection.** Market availability is read from the Nosana blockchain via `client.jobs.markets()`, not the REST API (which always returns empty). The system shows real idle node counts per market and selects markets with actual available GPUs. A `MarketClaimTracker` with an async mutex prevents parallel deploys from oversaturating the same market.

**Smart Market Distribution.** Each deployment independently selects its own market via `selectAndClaim()` (atomic lock). Deploys spread across markets based on effective idle nodes (blockchain idle minus already-claimed). If a worker times out (150s), it retries on up to 3 different markets before giving up.

**Multimodal Media Pipeline.** Video missions pre-boot ComfyUI (`docker.io/nosana/comfyui:2.0.5`) at T=0 alongside workers (skipped when `IMAGE_API_KEY` is set, since DALL-E 3 handles images via API). Image generation falls back through: DALL-E 3 (if `IMAGE_API_KEY` set), ComfyUI SD 1.5 on Nosana, fal.ai Flux, manual endpoint. TTS falls back through: ElevenLabs (with word-level timestamps), OpenAI, fal.ai PlayAI, Coqui on Nosana GPU.

**Adaptive Video Duration.** The orchestrator parses duration from mission text ("30-second video", "2-minute video", "1:30 video"). Word count, scene count, and seconds-per-scene are calculated dynamically at ~150 words per minute. Range: 15s (3 scenes, 37 words) to 5min (50 scenes, 750 words). Defaults to 30s if no duration specified. SceneWriter prompts include structured image prompt rules (shot type, lighting, style, mood) for diverse DALL-E/SD output.

**Web Search Enrichment.** Researcher agents use Tavily via `plugin-web-search`. After the initial response, `WorkerClient` polls for up to 90 seconds waiting for a web-enriched follow-up (the REPLY, WEB_SEARCH, REPLY pattern). Takes the longest response found.

**Pipeline Error Handling.** If a critical dependency fails (e.g. ScriptWriter can't boot), all downstream steps are automatically skipped instead of producing garbage output. The mission reports partial completion with succeeded/failed/skipped counts.

**Cost Tracking.** Live cost counter in the header and fleet dashboard. Per-agent cost/hr, total spent, and Nosana credit balance. GPU market cards show idle node counts from blockchain data (green = idle, yellow = busy, gray = queued).

**Dual Socket.IO Messaging.** Two Socket.IO channels serve different purposes. ElizaOS Socket.IO (port 3000) handles user chat and bookend messages that persist to conversation history. Fleet API Socket.IO (port 3001) handles ephemeral mission progress updates, bypassing ElizaOS database inserts. The frontend connects to both and merges messages into one chat stream.

## 🎬 Media Pipeline

Video missions run a 5-step pipeline: Researcher, ScriptWriter, SceneWriter + Narrator (parallel), VideoGenerator. Image generation and TTS each have a multi-backend fallback chain.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Image Generation
        I0{IMAGE_API_KEY set?}
        I0 -->|Yes| I1[OpenAI DALL-E 3 API]
        I0 -->|No| I2[ComfyUI SD 1.5 on Nosana]
        I1 -->|fail| I2
        I2 -->|fail| I3[fal.ai Flux]
        I3 -->|fail| I4[Manual endpoint]
    end
    subgraph Text-to-Speech
        T1[ElevenLabs] -->|fail| T2[OpenAI TTS]
        T2 -->|fail| T3[fal.ai PlayAI]
        T3 -->|fail| T4[Coqui on Nosana GPU]
    end
    subgraph Video Assembly
        Scenes[Scene Images] --> FFmpeg[FFmpeg Slideshow]
        Audio[TTS Audio] --> FFmpeg
        FFmpeg --> MP4[Output .mp4]
    end
```

When `IMAGE_API_KEY` is set (sk- prefix), DALL-E 3 handles all image generation (no GPU deployment needed, ~5s per image). When not set, ComfyUI uses `docker.io/nosana/comfyui:2.0.5` with SD 1.5 model from Nosana's S3 cache. Boot timeout is 600s (10 min) to allow model download. Pre-booted at T=0 alongside workers so it's ready when the VideoGenerator step needs it. The video pipeline routes all scene images through `ImageGenRouter.generate()`, which respects the IMAGE_API_KEY preference and falls back to ComfyUI on-demand if DALL-E fails.

## 💰 GPU Market Selection

Each deployment acquires an async mutex lock, selects a market, and claims it atomically before releasing the lock. This prevents parallel deploys from all picking the same 1-node market.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Deploy Request] --> Lock[Acquire mutex lock]
    Lock --> Fetch[Fetch markets + blockchain data]
    Fetch --> P1{Effective idle > 0?}
